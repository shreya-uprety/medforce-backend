The recent course of Amoxicillin-Clavulanate, a known hepatotoxic agent, strongly points towards a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) as the likely cause, particularly a cholestatic pattern. The nausea is also consistent with liver dysfunction. The INR is only borderline elevated, suggesting the synthetic function of the liver is not yet severely compromised.",

While drug-induced hepatitis is a strong consideration given the recent Augmentin use, viral hepatitis (e.g., Hepatitis A, B, or C) remains a significant differential diagnosis that needs to be ruled out, especially given the acute presentation and elevated bilirubin.",

The denial of RUQ pain makes gallstone cholecystitis less likely but doesn't exclude other forms of obstruction.",
