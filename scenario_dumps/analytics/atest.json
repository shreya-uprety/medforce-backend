The patient also mentioned itching, which the nurse only began to address at the very end of the provided transcript, missing an opportunity to explore this symptom earlier and more thoroughly."

More importantly, the nurse missed opportunities to actively listen and engage with the patient's emotional state and non-verbal cues. The patient's initial outburst and later description of itching suggest significant distress that was not fully explored or validated, leading to a less collaborative interaction."
