Gemini Voice Session Manager

Manages background connection to Gemini Live API so users don't have to wait.
Uses a two-phase connection:
1. Start session (returns immediately with session ID)
2. Poll for status or connect when ready

This solves the ~85 second connection delay by doing the connection in background.
